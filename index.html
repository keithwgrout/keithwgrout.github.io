	<h1>First Blog Post</h1>
	<p>Hello!</p>
	<p>If you've somehow stumbled upon this site, I just want to say thank you for visiting!</p>
	<p>Finding a job in web development has been hard for me.</p>
	<p>So to that end, I've decided to keep track of my progress as I build this blog, as well as other portfolio pieces.</p>
	<p>This way I can be held accountable, as well as have something to show off to people who may be interested in giving me money.</p>
	<p>In it's current form it is just some text.</p>
	<p>Let's do it!</p>

	<p>Update: okay, these lists are getting out of hand. Let's tackle some stuff! </p>
	<p>Next up: adding a stylesheet</p>

	<p>For now, I'm just going to keep a task list, and learning list and work off that.</p>
