	<h1>Update 1</h1>
	<p>Hello, and thank you for visiting.</p> 
	<p>My name is Keith Grout</p>
	<p>I am a developer and designer, and this is my portfolio site.</p>
	<p>I work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
	<p>My goal is to update this site frequently, with new features.</p>
	<p>This page will be a sort of blog linking to my progress.</p>
	<p>Today is day 1, and I just wanted to say hi and establish some sort of form/structure.</p>

	<p>todo: add some portfolio stuff</p>
